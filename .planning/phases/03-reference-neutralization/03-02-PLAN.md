<objective>
Update all workflow files and README.md that mention model profiles to use abstract tier names instead of Claude-specific model names.

Purpose: These files present model profile choices to users during project setup, settings changes, and help display. They must use tier language so no model gets confused by seeing another family's branding in its instructions.

Output: Five files with neutralized profile descriptions.

Make these targeted string replacements in 4 workflow files:

**settings.md (lines 45-47) — AskUserQuestion option descriptions:**
Replace:
```
{ label: "Quality", description: "Opus everywhere except verification (highest cost)" },
{ label: "Balanced (Recommended)", description: "Opus for planning, Sonnet for execution/verification" },
{ label: "Budget", description: "Sonnet for writing, Haiku for research/verification (lowest cost)" }
```
With:
```
{ label: "Quality", description: "Reasoning tier everywhere except verification (highest cost)" },
{ label: "Balanced (Recommended)", description: "Reasoning for planning, Standard for execution/verification" },
{ label: "Budget", description: "Standard for writing, Fast for research/verification (lowest cost)" }
```

**set-profile.md (line 2) — Purpose text:**
Replace: `Controls which Claude model each agent uses, balancing quality vs token spend.`
With: `Controls which AI model tier each agent uses, balancing quality vs token spend.`

**set-profile.md (lines 57-61) — Example confirmation table:**
Replace column header "Model" with "Tier", and replace values:
```
| Agent | Tier |
|-------|------|
| gsd-planner | reasoning |
| gsd-executor | standard |
| gsd-verifier | fast |
| ... | ... |
```

**help.md (lines 307-309) — set-profile descriptions:**
Replace:
```
- `quality` — Opus everywhere except verification
- `balanced` — Opus for planning, Sonnet for execution (default)
- `budget` — Sonnet for writing, Haiku for research/verification
```
With:
```
- `quality` — Reasoning tier everywhere except verification
- `balanced` — Reasoning for planning, Standard for execution (default)
- `budget` — Standard for writing, Fast for research/verification
```

**new-project.md (lines 314-316) — Model Profile AskUserQuestion options:**
Replace:
```
{ label: "Balanced (Recommended)", description: "Sonnet for most agents — good quality/cost ratio" },
{ label: "Quality", description: "Opus for research/roadmap — higher cost, deeper analysis" },
{ label: "Budget", description: "Haiku where possible — fastest, lowest cost" }
```
With:
```
{ label: "Balanced (Recommended)", description: "Standard tier for most agents — good quality/cost ratio" },
{ label: "Quality", description: "Reasoning tier for research/roadmap — higher cost, deeper analysis" },
{ label: "Budget", description: "Fast tier where possible — fastest, lowest cost" }
```

Do NOT change anything else in these files. These are targeted string replacements only.

Run these greps and expect ZERO results for each:
```
grep -n 'Opus\|Sonnet\|Haiku\|opus\|sonnet\|haiku' get-shit-done/workflows/settings.md
grep -n 'Opus\|Sonnet\|Haiku\|opus\|sonnet\|haiku' get-shit-done/workflows/set-profile.md
grep -n 'Opus\|Sonnet\|Haiku\|opus\|sonnet\|haiku' get-shit-done/workflows/help.md
grep -n 'Opus\|Sonnet\|Haiku\|opus\|sonnet\|haiku' get-shit-done/workflows/new-project.md
```
  </verify>
  <done>All four workflow files use abstract tier names in their profile descriptions. No Claude model names remain as quality descriptors. NEUT-03, NEUT-04, NEUT-05, NEUT-06 requirements satisfied.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update README.md model profiles section</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Update the Model Profiles section in README.md (lines ~491-499):

**Line 493 — Section description:**
Replace: `Control which Claude model each agent uses. Balance quality vs token spend.`
With: `Control which AI model tier each agent uses. Balance quality vs token spend.`

**Lines 495-499 — Model Profiles table:**
Replace cell values with title-case tier names (no "tier" suffix in table cells):
```
| Profile | Planning | Execution | Verification |
|---------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| `quality` | Reasoning | Reasoning | Standard |
| `balanced` (default) | Reasoning | Standard | Standard |
| `budget` | Standard | Standard | Fast |
```

Do NOT change anything else in README.md.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run: `grep -n 'Opus\|Sonnet\|Haiku' README.md`
Must return ZERO results. Read lines 491-500 to confirm the table is correctly formatted.
  </verify>
  <done>README.md model profiles section uses abstract tier names. Table shows Reasoning/Standard/Fast instead of Opus/Sonnet/Haiku.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After both tasks complete, run the comprehensive validation:
```
grep -rn '\b[Oo]pus\b\|\b[Ss]onnet\b\|\b[Hh]aiku\b' get-shit-done/ --include='*.md' README.md
```
This should return ZERO results. The only legitimate occurrences of Claude model names should be in `gsd-tools.js` (PROVIDER_MODELS mapping table), not in any markdown file.
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- settings.md, set-profile.md, help.md, new-project.md all use tier names in profile descriptions
- README.md model profiles table uses Reasoning/Standard/Fast
- No workflow, reference, or template markdown file contains Opus/Sonnet/Haiku as quality descriptors
- NEUT-03, NEUT-04, NEUT-05, NEUT-06 requirements satisfied
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/03-reference-neutralization/03-02-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
