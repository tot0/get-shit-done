Your FEATURES.md feeds into requirements definition. Categorize clearly:
- Table stakes (must have or users leave)
- Differentiators (competitive advantage)
- Anti-features (things to deliberately NOT build)
</downstream_consumer>

<quality_gate>
# Universal
- [ ] At least 3 recommendations explicitly reference project context (not generic best practices)
- [ ] Confidence level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) assigned to each major recommendation with reasoning
- [ ] At least 2 sources cited per section (Context7, official docs, or URLs — not training data alone)

# Features specific
- [ ] Categories are clear (table stakes vs differentiators vs anti-features)
- [ ] Complexity noted for each feature
- [ ] Dependencies between features identified

# Feature Research

**Domain:** [domain type]
**Researched:** [date]
**Confidence:** [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]

## Feature Landscape

### Table Stakes (Users Expect These)

Features users assume exist. Missing these = product feels incomplete.

| Feature | Why Expected | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|--------------|------------|-------|
| [feature] | [user expectation] | LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH | [implementation notes] |
| [feature] | [user expectation] | LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH | [implementation notes] |
| [feature] | [user expectation] | LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH | [implementation notes] |

### Differentiators (Competitive Advantage)

Features that set the product apart. Not required, but valuable.

| Feature | Value Proposition | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| [feature] | [why it matters] | LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH | [implementation notes] |
| [feature] | [why it matters] | LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH | [implementation notes] |
| [feature] | [why it matters] | LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH | [implementation notes] |

### Anti-Features (Commonly Requested, Often Problematic)

Features that seem good but create problems.

| Feature | Why Requested | Why Problematic | Alternative |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| [feature] | [surface appeal] | [actual problems] | [better approach] |
| [feature] | [surface appeal] | [actual problems] | [better approach] |

## Feature Dependencies

```
[Feature A]
    └──requires──> [Feature B]
                       └──requires──> [Feature C]

[Feature D] ──enhances──> [Feature A]

[Feature E] ──conflicts──> [Feature F]
```

### Dependency Notes

- **[Feature A] requires [Feature B]:** [why the dependency exists]
- **[Feature D] enhances [Feature A]:** [how they work together]
- **[Feature E] conflicts with [Feature F]:** [why they're incompatible]

## MVP Definition

### Launch With (v1)

Minimum viable product — what's needed to validate the concept.

- [ ] [Feature] — [why essential]
- [ ] [Feature] — [why essential]
- [ ] [Feature] — [why essential]

### Add After Validation (v1.x)

Features to add once core is working.

- [ ] [Feature] — [trigger for adding]
- [ ] [Feature] — [trigger for adding]

### Future Consideration (v2+)

Features to defer until product-market fit is established.

- [ ] [Feature] — [why defer]
- [ ] [Feature] — [why defer]

## Feature Prioritization Matrix

| Feature | User Value | Implementation Cost | Priority |
|---------|------------|---------------------|----------|
| [feature] | HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW | HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW | P1/P2/P3 |
| [feature] | HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW | HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW | P1/P2/P3 |
| [feature] | HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW | HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW | P1/P2/P3 |

**Priority key:**
- P1: Must have for launch
- P2: Should have, add when possible
- P3: Nice to have, future consideration

## Competitor Feature Analysis

| Feature | Competitor A | Competitor B | Our Approach |
|---------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| [feature] | [how they do it] | [how they do it] | [our plan] |
| [feature] | [how they do it] | [how they do it] | [our plan] |
