# FORK.md - GSD Fork Documentation

This fork of [get-shit-done](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done) extends the base system with 6 integrated feature systems, all delivered natively via `git clone` + `node install.js`.

## Overview

This fork adds the following systems on top of upstream GSD:

1. **Code-Search Integration** - Optional MCP-based code search tools injected into agents
2. **Critic Agents** - 6 specialized critic agents (plan, code, scope, verify, discuss, strategy) for quality gates
3. **Dynamic Researchers** - 11 researcher types with AI-powered selection and adaptive synthesis
4. **Adaptive Synthesizer** - Synthesizer agent that adapts output format to researcher findings
5. **Mistake Registry** - Structured mistake capture, storage, and critic integration
6. **Taste Library** - Decision preference extraction, storage, and consultation during planning

## Installation

### From Fork (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danhalem-microsoft/get-shit-done.git
cd get-shit-done
node bin/install.js --global
```

### Runtime Options

```bash
node bin/install.js --global          # Install to ~/.claude/ (default)
node bin/install.js --local           # Install to ./.claude/
node bin/install.js --claude --global # Explicit Claude Code
node bin/install.js --opencode --global
node bin/install.js --gemini --global
node bin/install.js --codex --global
```

## Code-Search Integration

Code-search MCP server access is **optional** and auto-detected during installation.

### How It Works

1. Agent files in the fork contain template markers: `<!-- code-search-tools -->` and `<!-- code-search-guidance -->`
2. During `node install.js`, the installer checks `~/.claude/settings.json` for a `code-search` key in `mcpServers`
3. **If detected**: Markers are replaced with `, mcp__code-search__*` tools and a guidance block
4. **If not detected**: Markers are removed cleanly (agents work without code-search)

### Affected Agents

- `gsd-codebase-mapper.md` - Uses code-search during codebase analysis
- `gsd-executor.md` - Uses code-search during implementation
- `gsd-planner.md` - Uses code-search during plan creation
- `gsd-debugger.md` - Uses code-search during debugging
- `gsd-verifier.md` - Uses code-search during verification
- `gsd-phase-researcher.md` - Uses code-search during phase research
- `gsd-project-researcher.md` - Uses code-search during project research

### Setting Up Code-Search

To enable code-search, add it to your `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "code-search": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/code-search-server/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then re-run `node bin/install.js --global` to inject the tools.

## Upstream Sync

### Adding Upstream Remote

```bash
cd /path/to/your/get-shit-done
git remote add upstream https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done.git
```

### Syncing with Upstream

Use the built-in command:

```
/gsd:sync-upstream
```

Or manually:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
# Resolve any conflicts
node bin/install.js --global
```

### Conflict Resolution

Files most likely to conflict during upstream sync:

| File | Why | Resolution |
|------|-----|------------|
| `bin/install.js` | Template expansion functions added | Keep fork additions, merge upstream changes |
| `get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs` | Critic/researcher/mistake/taste commands | Keep fork additions, merge upstream changes |
| `agents/gsd-*.md` | Template markers added | Keep fork markers, merge upstream agent changes |
| `get-shit-done/workflows/update.md` | Fork update section added | Keep fork section, merge upstream changes |

## Fork Architecture

### install-manifest.json

Declarative manifest mapping source paths to installation destinations:

```
install-manifest.json
  sources:
    workflows/    -> get-shit-done/workflows/   (copy-with-path-replacement)
    researchers/  -> get-shit-done/researchers/  (copy-with-path-replacement)
    bin/          -> get-shit-done/bin/           (copy-raw)
    references/   -> get-shit-done/references/   (copy-with-path-replacement)
    templates/    -> get-shit-done/templates/     (copy-with-path-replacement)
    agents/       -> agents/                     (copy-with-path-replacement + template markers)
    commands/gsd/ -> commands/gsd/               (copy-with-path-replacement)
```

### Template Markers

Template markers in agent files enable conditional feature injection:

- `<!-- code-search-tools -->` - Replaced with MCP tool list or removed
- `<!-- code-search-guidance -->` - Replaced with guidance block or removed

Detection happens at install time, not runtime.

### verify-install.js

After installation, verify integrity:

```bash
node scripts/verify-install.js  # If available
```

## Troubleshooting

### Code-search not injected into agents

1. Verify `~/.claude/settings.json` has `mcpServers` with a `code-search` key
2. Re-run `node bin/install.js --global`
3. Check installed agents: `grep "mcp__code-search" ~/.claude/agents/gsd-executor.md`

### Template markers visible in installed agents

If you see `<!-- code-search-tools -->` in installed agent files, the template expansion didn't run. Re-run `node bin/install.js --global`.

### Upstream merge conflicts

1. `git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/main`
2. Resolve conflicts keeping fork additions (template markers, new functions)
3. `node bin/install.js --global` to re-install
4. Verify: no template markers visible in `~/.claude/agents/`

### Commands not found

1. Verify `~/.claude/commands/gsd/` contains all command files
2. Restart Claude Code to reload commands
3. Re-run `node bin/install.js --global`
